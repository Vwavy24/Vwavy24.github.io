## About me

My name is Varvara Rousseau and I am a first year M.S. candidate studying Epidemiology planing to graduate in 2024. I am a child of Haitian immigrants living on Long Island.  I am interested in concentrating on infectious disease or chronic epidemiology with the hope of working for the CDC or at a biotechnology company like pfizer.  After I graduate with my master's I do plan on pursuing a Phd.
